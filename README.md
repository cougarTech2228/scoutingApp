This is an in progress application for recording FRC match information and streaming it to a database, for the purpose of statagy.

The application will be terminal based and use 6 joysticks (other input devices MAY be implemented)

The current name is "CATS" a scrambled acronym for "CougarTech Scouting Application"

The goal is to have a simple and effective means of FRC scouting, which can easily be modified for next years game

Pit scouting is expected to be implemented as well

This program should be coded according to the guidelines outlined in PEP8, (This means spaces, no tabs)
