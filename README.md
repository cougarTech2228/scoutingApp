===========
CATS v0.4.1
Produced by FIRST Team 2228 CougarTech

This is a work in progress application for collecting and recording FRC match information, and interpreting
the collected data to give meaningful statistics on the performance of given robots.

The application's name, "CATS", is a scrambled acronym for "CougarTech Scouting Application"

The application will feature both a CLI and GUI and use 6 joysticks for primary input during match data collection
keyboard input will be used otherwise

The goal is to have a simple and effective means to scout FRC Competitions
which can easily be modified to be usable for the 2014 FRC Challenge Aerial Assist

This program should be coded according to the guidelines outlined in PEP8, (This means spaces, no tabs)
